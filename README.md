# TrainingJournal2

For trainers, individuals just starting their fitness journey ann anyone in between, the Training Journal app helps plan and log a workout session. Those who fail to plan, plan to fail, so in order to meet fitness goals, planning is key. The training journal allows one to find and log a workout which fits the target group. For example, a person would like to do cardio, but is sick of running; this person can select cardio as a target and the Training Journal will give a list of cardio workouts to choose from.
